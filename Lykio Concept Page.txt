Lykio DST Page

“Feral and divine, a mage of fire, ice, and death. His hunger is endless, his power ancient, his dignity eternal.”

Blurb:
	Feral and divine, Lykió walks the mortal realm cloaked in the form of a god-bound wolf. Once a succubus mage, his command over fire, ice, and death magics shapes his path as he endures the harsh wilderness. Haunted by endless hunger yet dignified in spirit, Lykió stands as a solemn guardian — both predator and protector — caught between ancient power and fragile mortality.

	Master the balance of elemental forces and primal instinct. Survive as Lykió, where every step echoes with the weight of a forgotten divinity.
